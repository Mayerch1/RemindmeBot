Privacy Notice for **FuelBot**

Please note that this bot is **not** a service provided by or affiliated with Discord Inc.
This notice has no implications on the *Discord Privacy notice*. Both documents coexist independently.

__**Data collection**__
The bot does not collect or store any user data.
The bot does not forward any user data to third parties.

Whenever a command is invoked, the entered data is temporarily held in volatile memory, which is discarded on completion of the command. The invocation of the command itself is not logged (see: *Error case*).

__Direct Feedback__
If you choose to enter feedback using the `Direct Feedback` (`/help`), the inputted text is sent into a private channel on the "Bot Support Server" (see `/help` as well).
This private feedback channel is only visible for developers of this library and is not downloaded to our devices.

__Data Request__
You cannot request automatically collected user data, as there is no data stored to be requested.
To get entered feedback data, join the Support Server (`/help`) and DM/tag a Mod to receive your entered feedbacks.

__Deletion Request__
You cannot request a deletion of automatically collected data, as there is no data stored to be deleted.
To delete previously given feedback, join the Support Server (`/help`) and DM/tag a Mod with your request.

__**Error case**__
In case a command causes an unexpected error, a so called `Stack-Trace` is dumped into log files.
This stack trace does log the invocation of a command, but does not contain any personal information.

This privacy policy itself may be updated or extended without prior warning or notification.
