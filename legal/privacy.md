Privacy Notice for **RemindmeBot**

Please note that this bot is **not** a service provided by or affiliated with Discord Inc.
This notice has no implications on the *Discord Privacy notice*. Both documents coexist independently.


Data stored by this bot is never shared with 3rd parties.
All data remains "In-house" at any given points.

If the bot is kicked from a server, all information is deleted (see exceptions below).


__**Midterm User Data**__
Whenever a reminder is created, the bot stores all information required to deliver the reminder in a database.
These information are only used to deliver the reminder and will be deleted once the reminder elapsed or has no future occurrences (whichever is later).


__**Long Term User Data**__
The bot stores all settings (`/settings`) as long term data.
This means that any custom settings will be stored as long as the bot is on your server.


__Direct Feedback__
If you choose to enter feedback using the `Direct Feedback` (`/help`), the inputted text is sent into a private channel on the "Bot Support Server", in combination with your discord user ID.
The personal data given in the direct feedback will only be used to improve the bot. The feedback is only visible to Moderators of the Server.

An automatic removal of this feedback is not possible, as the Bot doesn't store any relations between users and feedback.
If you want your feedback to be deleted, you need to manually join the Support Server.


__Analytics__
Some actions (Reminder Creation, `/help` call, ...) will be written into an Analytics Database.
The only data stored in this database, is *what* event occurred and *when* in occurred. The content of the event is never stored, 
which leads to a removal of all identifying and personal data like *User ID* or *Reminder Content*.

This data cannot be deleted as it's completely anonymized and not back-trackable.
